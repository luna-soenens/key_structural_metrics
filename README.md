# Key Structural Metrics 🌱
This repository is to extract key structural metrics to describe a forest ecosystem.

⬆️ In this repository, I want to explore the different structural metrics and the different paths I can use to quantify those metrics.

My plan:

1. **Canopy Metrics** 🌄 - Obtained from **Canopy Height Models** (using *lidR* R package) an **Vertical Plant Profiles** (using *pylidar* Python library)
   canopy cover (CC), canopy height distribution (Z), gap probability (Pgap), plant area volume density (PAVD), plant area index (PAI), foliage height density (FHD), effective number of layers (ENL), ...
2. **Tree Demography Metrics** 🌳 - Obtained from **individual trees** generated from *semantic tree segmentation* (using RiSCAN Pro program and *ITSMe* R package).
   stand density (N), diameter distribution (DBH), crown area (CA), ...

Right now, it is just the beginning of my research, but updates are coming soon! 🌟
